# DUEL: Dialogues Unfolding for Eternity and Lunacy

Welcome to **DUEL** — the infinite, browser-based AI argument simulator! Watch two over-the-top personalities (especially Asian moms) argue forever about any topic you choose. All powered by a real, local AI model running in your browser. No backend. No filters. Just pure, unfiltered debate.

## 🚀 Features
- **Fully Client-Side**: No server, no data sent anywhere. Everything runs in your browser using WebGPU.
- **Asian Mom Showdown**: Pick from a cast of fierce Asian moms (Chinese, Indian, Korean) and watch them roast each other (or you) endlessly.
- **Custom Topics**: Type any topic or use the 🎲 dice for a random, meme-worthy argument.
- **Auto-Fight Mode**: Let the AIs argue with each other, or jump in and argue yourself.
- **Animated UI**: Enjoy a starry background and smooth, modern interface.

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Open in Chrome or Edge** (with WebGPU enabled):
   - [Check your browser's WebGPU support here](https://webgpureport.org/)
2. **Pick your fighters**: Choose "Me" or one of the Asian moms for each side.
3. **Enter a topic** (or click the dice for a random one).
4. **Click FIGHT** and watch the argument unfold!
5. **Auto-Fight**: Let the AIs go at it, or type your own responses to join the fray.

## 🧩 Requirements
- **Browser**: Chrome or Edge (latest), with WebGPU enabled
- **No installation needed**: Just open `index.html` in your browser
- **Internet**: Required only for the first model load (uses CDN)

---

## 🤖 Model Details
- Uses a **1B parameter Llama/ONNX model** (or GPT-2 fallback) via [transformers.js](https://xenova.github.io/transformers.js/)
- All inference is local — nothing leaves your device
- Model loads may take a minute on first run (watch the spinner!)

---

## 📝 Customization
- Add your own fighters or personalities in `last.js`
- Change the argument list, UI, or styles as you wish

## ⚠️ Limitations & Fun
> **This project is a meme, a demo, and a playground.**
>
> - The arguments are wild, but the logic is... well, 1B-parameter-level. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes nonsense, always entertaining.
> - Expect spicy, culturally flavored roasts — but also the occasional AI brainfart.
> - If you want GPT-4 quality, this isn't it. But for what you can get out of a 1B parameter model running in your browser, it's pretty cool (and hilarious)!
